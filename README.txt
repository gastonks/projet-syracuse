For the execution of the program, you need to be at the root of the project and write in the terminal :
    './bin/analyse.bash [FIRST_NUMBER] [SECOND_NUMBER]'

An example :
    './bin/analyse.bash 100 500'

The graphs will be created in the 'img/' directory and all the temporary data will be deleted at the end of the program.

If you need help you can write :
    './bin/analyse.bash -h'
